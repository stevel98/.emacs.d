Social network (?) that lets you tell other people when you're
bored

ML to figure out if you're bored based on phone/computer activity (ROFL)
    -Then suggest hanging out?

Party-based social network:
    -Can create circles of people which are automatically invited
     when you post you're having a party
    -Or rly just to let people know you want to hang?
    -making it look like robinhood would be cool

Website that lets you randomly trade spotify playlists with another user
    -No control over it, just get a random playlist and say yes/no to swap
        -Should both have to say yes? Or if either says yes then they get the other's playlist?
    -Or maybe just let random people see what you're listening to
    -Ideally the current playlist
