Social network (?) that lets you tell other people when you're
bored

ML to figure out if you're bored based on phone/computer activity (ROFL)
    -Then suggest hanging out?

Party-based social network:
    -Can create circles of people which are automatically invited
     when you post you're having a party
    -Or rly just to let people know you want to hang?
    -Robinhood-inspired design
